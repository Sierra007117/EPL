This is an interpreter based on the zombie programming language!

Differences between my interpreter and the specification
---
-"animate" and "disturb" can no longer be used to activate entities from 
inside of other entities. Those commands also function as block endings, so
 it would be like naming a Java method "}". "Invoke" is used in place of 
these.

-Expressions are read from left to right, but I attempted to make it 
compatable with right-to-left reading zombie interpreters. If this 
seriously bothers you or causes massive problems with your code, I have 
included the source code with this so you can change it.

-"Invoke" simply starts whatever entity it is being used on. In the 
original specification, it creates a copy of the entity with the exact same
 name, which would only lead to confusion.

-Entities can no longer perform several tasks at once.

-There's probably more that I couldn't think of off the top of my head.
